          - Fixed RT #59674 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=59674),
                When SSL support is needed but not installed, a more specific
            error messages is now displayed, instead of "not DAV enabled or not accessible".

  v0.40 (released 2010/01/27):
    *   bug fixes

          - Fixed RT #47500 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=47500),
                HTTP::DAV::Comms->credentials() method erroneously autovivified
                basic authentication internal values, causing wrong or undefined
                credentials to be sent out, or credentials to be "forgot" by HTTP::DAV.

  v0.39 (released 2009/12/12):
    *   bug fixes

          - Fixed RT #52665 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=52665),
                Using dave or propfind() on URLs containing escaped chars (%xx) could fail,
                due to upper/lower case differences. Thanks to cebjyre for the patch
                and the test case.

  v0.38 (released 2009/06/09):
    *   bug fixes

          - Fixed RT #14506 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=14506),
            about the missing get_lastresponse() method. It was a documentation bug.

          - Fixed RT #29788 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=29788),
            avoid file corruptions on Win32 when calling HTTP::DAV::get() method.

          - Fixed RT #31014 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=31014),
            probably already in v0.34, since it seems related to propfind() "depth" bug.

  v0.37 (released 2009/03/24):
    *   bug fixes

          - Fixed RT #44409 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=44409),
            Small bug in HTTP::DAV::put(). Passing a reference as local content resulted
                in the "SCALAR(0x12345678)" being logged instead of the real scalar.

  v0.36 (released 2009/02/25):
    *   bug fixes

          - Fixed RT #19616 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=19616),
            LWP::UserAgent::redirect_ok() is not changed anymore. We're subclassing
            it from HTTP::DAV::UserAgent and overriding redirect_ok() there.

          - Fixed RT #42877 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42877),
            HTTP::DAV::UserAgent::credentials() has been modified to behave like
            LWP::UserAgent::credentials(), otherwise basic authentication breakages
            can occur.

          - Fixed a problem with C<-depth> argument to C<HTTP::DAV::propfind()> that
            could lead to massive performance degradation, especially when running
                C<propfind()> against large folders.
                C<-depth> was set to 1 even when passed as zero.

  v0.35 (released 2008/11/03):
    *   bug fixes

          - Fixed RT #40318 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40318),
            about getting single or multiple files directly to \*STDOUT.

  v0.34 (released 2008/09/11):
    *   bug fixes

          - Fixed RT #39150 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39150),
            about downloading multiple files in the same directory.

  v0.33 (released 2008/08/24):
    *   documentation

          - Clearly state that opera software asa is now co-maintainer of http::dav

          - Fixed various inconsistencies in the v0.32 documentation

  v0.32 (released 2008/08/24):
    *   incompatibilities

         - Now HTTP::DAV requires Perl 5.6.0+ and Scalar::Util (core in 5.8.x).

    *   bug fixes

         - Now HTTP::DAV objects are correctly released from memory when
           they go out of scope. Now it should be possible to use multiple instances
           of HTTP::DAV even in long-running processes.

           Was caused by circular references between HTTP::DAV and HTTP::DAV::Resource.

  v0.31 (released 2002/04/13):
    *   Apache 2 mod_dav support

         - Now works with mod_dav under Apache 2.

    *   bug fixes

         - Fixed bug to correctly handle the put/get of filenames with spaces in them.

         - Fixed bug to allow the PUT of empty files.

         - put() now uses binmode so that it works under Windows.

         - HTTP redirect code added in the previous release was incorrectly returning a HTTP::Response instead of a HTTP::DAV::Response

         - Fixed bug to allow https for copy and move (http:// was hardcoded).

         - Fixed strange copy/move bug for Apache2.0's mod_dav.

  v0.29 (released 2001/10/31):
    *   https

        https support as provided from the underlying LWP library has been
        tested against mod_dav and mod_ssl. Seems to work well. See
        INSTALLATION for more detail.

    *   Digest authentication

        Requires MD5 to be installed. See INSTALLATION notes.

    *   various bug fixes

    *   more powerful callback support for get()

        Useful for giving progress indicators.

    *   get() to filehandles and scalar references

        the get() routine now allows you to pass by reference a filehandle
        or scalar in which to save the contents of the GET request.

    *   added namespace abbreviations in proppatch

        Thanks to Jeremy for this patch.

    *   improved redirect handling in Comms.pm

        Thanks to Jeremy for this patch.

  v0.23 (released 2001/09/07):
    *   file globbing for get and put

        HTTP::DAV::get() and HTTP::DAV::put() now supports file globs. This
        functionality also propagates to dave. This allows you to do the
        following:

         dav> put /tmp/index*.html
         dav> get index[12].htm? /tmp

         ?,* and sets ([]) are supported. See the docs for details.

        HTTP::DAV now requires the Perl module File::Glob which comes
        bundled with perl5.6 and later.

    *   bug fix in -overwrite flag in HTTP::DAV::copy/move.

  v0.22 (released 2001/09/03)
    Complete overhaul of API, recursive get and put, addition of dave.

    *   dave -- the new command line client

        I wrote dave (the DAV Explorer) because I needed an end-user
        application that allowed me to "feel" how well the HTTP::DAV API was
        performing. dave is quite similar to Joe Orton's C-based DAV client
        called cadaver (yes, imitation is the best form of flattery).

    *   A new and simpler API

        This new API is accessed directly through the HTTP::DAV module and
        is based on the core API written in previous releases.

    *   new methods

        The new API now supports, proppatch, recursive get and put.

    *   A substantial core API overhaul

        Moving from v0.05 to v0.22 in one release might indicate the amount
        of work gone into this release.

    *   A new interoperability test suite

        is now included in PerlDAV. The test suite is built on top of the
        standard Perl Test::Harness modules. Still in development, the test
        suite is highlighting interoperability problems with DAV-servers a
        lot quicker than before. See "the test suite & interoperability"
        section.

  v0.05 (released 2001/07/24)
    General bug fixes and addition of proppatch

     - added PROPPATCH method to HTTP::DAV::Resource, thanks to Sylvain Plancon.
     - fixed uninitialized warnings in test scripts.
     - fixed new lock bug in DAV::Lock, thanks to Ben Evans
     - fixed dumb mistake where PUT was calling get instead of put, 
       thanks to Sylvain and Ben again.
     - fixed call to Utils::bad, thanks to Sylvain

  v0.04 (released 2000/04/25)
    Initial Release

     - supports PUT,GET,MLCOL,DELETE,OPTIONS,PROPFIND,LOCK,UNLOCK,steal_lock,lock_discovery
